            Hi, this is Prashant Subedi.

            I love Programming. Well, actually I don't, I just love pretending that I love programming.
            
            But recently, I've been miserable, miserable with myself. The worst I could ever be. I am a failed misery. How will I rise again? I wonder who will help me break this bubble.

            I'm stuck...
            I have failed.
            I'm dying.

            I'm a failure.
            Just another mediocre Joe.

            Tomorrow it's Dashain.
            Not much of a excitement.

            It's the day, the day of dashain.
